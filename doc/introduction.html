<p>NCCL is a communication library targetted at CUDA devices. It is optimized to
perform inter-device data movement and reductions.
<p>NCCL is able to work on single nodes as well as multiple nodes, using a
combination of NVLink, PCI point-to-point, shared memory, Infiniband or Sockets.
<p>NCCL implements 5 collective operations : allreduce, reduce, broadcast,
reduce_scatter and allgather. The API is similar to MPI equivalent operations.
