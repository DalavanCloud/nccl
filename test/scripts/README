1) To run tests, call the root-side (aggregation node) script: 
    ./nccl_test_root.sh  <hostfile>  <branch>
  
If <hostfile> is not specified, the script will look for ./hostfile

If <branch> is not specified, the script will use the 'master'

Format for the <hostfile>:
  hostname1 gpumodel1
  hostname2 gpumodel2
  ...

The script will gather results from slave nodes under a newly-created <branch> folder. It will also rename the old <branch> folder as <branch>.bak



2) Slave-side (worker node) script:
    ./nccl_test_node.sh  <gpumodel>

The script can be called independently of the root if you only need results on a single node
